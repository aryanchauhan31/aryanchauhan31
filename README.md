# 👋 Hi, I'm Aryan Chauhan

I'm a graduate student at **NYU** pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering, passionate about building efficient and scalable AI systems. I focus on **LLM optimization**, **multimodal models**, and **open-source contributions**—most recently to the 🤗 `transformers` library.
