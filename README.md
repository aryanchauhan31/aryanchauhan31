## üöÄ Recent Work



### ü§ó Hugging Face Transformers

- **[#38461: Enable `device_map="auto"` support for Dinov2](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/38461)**  
  Enabled automatic device placement for Dinov2 by defining `_no_split_modules`, unlocking inference across CPU/GPU seamlessly.

- **[#38285: Add `GLPNImageProcessorFast`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/38285)**  
  Implemented a fast image processor variant for the GLPN model using TorchVision. Achieved functional parity with the original (max abs diff < 1e-7) and added complete tests.

### üì∏ Multimodal VQA Optimization
- Developed ViT+BERT architecture for Visual Question Answering.
- Trained with QAT + DDP over 4√óL4 GPUs for 1.8√ó speed-up and 60% model compression.

### üß† DistilBERT Compression Pipeline
- Reduced size by 64% with dynamic quantization.
- Automated finetuning and benchmarking via Hugging Face tools.

## üìà What I'm Looking For
I'm currently open to:
- Remote internships or research collaborations in **LLM efficiency**, **model compression**, or **AI infrastructure**
- Open-source projects focused on cutting-edge ML research
